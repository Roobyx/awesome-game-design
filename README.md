# Awesome Game design list 
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A list of publicly available Game design documents that I have found interesting. 
(Ok... the list is slowly evolving. The main focus will still be game design materials, but will also include additional cool tools at the end) 

I do not own any of these documents. If there are any copyrighted materials, they belong to the original authors.

Enjoy.
